# Bike Sharing Rental Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting bike rental counts using the Capital Bikeshare dataset from Washington, DC. Our goal is to explore various deep learning architectures to improve the accuracy of rental predictions, contributing to better resource allocation and improved bike-sharing services.

## Problem Statement
Bike-sharing systems have gained popularity as a sustainable transport solution. However, predicting the demand for bike rentals remains a challenge. Accurate predictions can help in optimizing bike distribution, ensuring availability, and enhancing user satisfaction.

## Models Implemented
This project includes implementations of the following architectures:
1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** - A basic neural network model to establish a baseline for performance.
2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** - A model designed to work with sequential data, capturing temporal dependencies.
3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** - A type of RNN that is better at learning long-term dependencies in data.
4. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** - Although typically used for image data, we will experiment with CNNs to analyze time series data for potential improvements in prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes hourly bike rental counts along with relevant weather and seasonal information for the years 2011 and 2012.
